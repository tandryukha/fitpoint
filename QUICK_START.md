# Fitpoint AI Smart Finder - Quick Start Guide

## 🚨 Fix for npm Errors

If you're getting npm errors like "Could not read package.json", you're likely in the wrong directory.

### The Problem
You're running `npm start` from `/Users/tandryukha/fitpoint` but the React application is located in `/Users/tandryukha/fitpoint/fitpoint-mock`.

### The Solution

**Step 1**: Navigate to the correct directory
```bash
cd fitpoint-mock
```

**Step 2**: Verify you're in the right place
```bash
ls -la
# You should see package.json, src/, public/, etc.
```

**Step 3**: Start the application
```bash
npm start
```

**Step 4**: Open your browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```
